# OBSClipper â€“ Discord Voice Chat Clip Bot with OBS Integration

OBSClipper is a Discord bot that listens for voice chat activity, interfaces with OBS to detect replay buffer saves, and sends clip messages to Discord.

---

## Features

* **Voice Channel Tracking**
  Monitors when a specific user joins/leaves a VC, along with all participants.

* **OBS Replay Buffer Listener**
  Automatically triggers on saved replay buffer events by playing a sound effect and sending a notification.

* **Smart Clip Sharing**
  Sends clip messages with clickable "Upload Clip" buttons.

* **Contextual Messaging**
  Saves who was in the VC, what app was active, and when the clip was made.

* **Configurable**
  Has many settings, including playing a sound effect when a clip is captured and remux settings.

* **Test Commands**
  `/get_vc_users`, `/upload_file`, `/kill_obs`, and `/search_for_user`

## ðŸ’¬ Slash Commands

| Command             | Description                                     |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `/upload_file`      | Sends a test `.mp4` file.                       |
| `/get_vc_users`     | Lists users currently in VC with the main user. |
| `/search_for_user`  | Searches for the main user across VCs.          |
| `/kill_obs`         | Force-disconnects from OBS.                     |

## How It Works

1. When the main user joins a VC, recording starts.
2. When OBS saves a replay buffer, the bot is notified.
3. A contextual message is sent to a Discord channel.
4. That message includes a **"Upload Clip"** button, usable only by the initiating user.
5. Clicking the button sends the actual media file from the bot.
Note that the bot must be running on the device that is storing the clips.

## FAQ

### **Why doesn't the bot upload the clip immediately after it's saved?**

Uploading large media files directly when a replay is saved can be limiting and disruptive, plus Discord imposes stricter file size limits when sending files through standard messages (`ctx`). However, when clips are shared via an interaction (such as pressing a button), Discord allows significantly larger uploads.
